/**
 * The API of this use case. It consists of GET requests only, so the process can be
 * walked through in a browser - no tooling, no request bodies.
 *
 * <p>
 * It talks to {@link Service} and to nothing else, and it says who is acting while it
 * does. The name comes in with the request because this blueprint has nobody logged in;
 * an application with a security framework reads the authenticated user, in a filter, and
 * then the API has nothing to do with the auditing either. What matters is where it sits:
 * around the call which opens the transaction, because Envers writes the revision when
 * that transaction commits.
